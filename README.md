## My name is Zhiromkina Evgeniia 
I am editor and student of Netology
### I've been working as a teacher for a long time
Later I became an editor. But now I want to be a developer 
### There are 3 reasons I have to get a job:
1. I learn easily (that's true)
2. I like team work (unfortunatly not)
3. I am funny and charming gal (and a bit immodest)
